### 🔍 Key Problem & Objective

* 💥 **Situation:** Identified a critical issue where payment failure rates spiked significantly (**up to 25% increase**) during **weekend peak hours**, severely impacting user experience and transaction volume.
* 🎯 **Objective:** Pinpoint the specific **bank partners** and **system bottlenecks** responsible for the failure spike.

### 🔬 Action & Skills Demonstrated

* 🛠️ **Methodology:** Leveraged **Statistical Modeling** and **Regression Analysis** (Python/R) on high-volume transaction logs.
* 📊 **Analysis:** Performed statistical analysis, isolating failure rates by **Time of Day, Day of Week, Bank Partner,** and **Transaction Type**. Included **Delay/Latency Analysis** to validate capacity issues.
* 📈 **Visualization:** Created real-time performance dashboards using **Power BI** for tracking and decision-making.

### ✅ Result & Business Impact

* 💡 **Outcome:** Findings led to targeted capacity planning and re-routing strategies.
* 💰 **Impact:** Projected a reduction in the peak-hour transaction failure rate by **1.8 percentage points** (a **25% reduction** in the failure spike), **protecting millions** in potential transaction revenue and boosting customer trust.
